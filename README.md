Tower of the Sorcerer simulator
===============================

This project simulates a playthrough of [Tower of the Sorcerer](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013374/game/egame0.html). The aim is to provide an easy way to test alternative paths through the tower, to help in finding an optimal path.

`simulator.py`: The game code.
`encounters.json`: Data describing the items, enemies, allies, objects, and effects that can be encountered.
`start.txt`: A work in progress detailing one possible path through the tower.
